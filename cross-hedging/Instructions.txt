Project Title: Optimal Cross-Hedging Strategy for Real-World Asset Pairs

Project Overview:
In this project, we will apply the concepts from Chapter 3 of "Options, Futures, and Derivatives" by John Hull to develop an optimal cross-hedging strategy for two related but distinct asset classes.
We will utilize historical price data, analyze the relationship between the assets, and determine the optimal number of contracts for cross-hedging.
The chosen asset pairs are Gold and Gold Mining Stocks. The Period of hedging is 3 months.


Step 1: Concept Understanding:

Read about the concepts of cross-hedging from Chapter 3 of "Options, Futures, and Derivatives" by John Hull.
Research the specific characteristics and factors influencing Gold and Gold Mining Stocks markets.


Step 2: Data Collection and Asset Selection:

Gather historical price data for Gold and a selection of Gold Mining Stocks.
Identify a suitable financial instrument to be used for cross-hedging (e.g., Gold Futures Contracts).


Step 3: Data Analysis:

Analyze the statistical properties of both assets including mean, standard deviation, and historical volatility.


Step 4: Developing Cross-Hedging Strategies:

Develop various cross-hedging strategies using different numbers of Gold Futures Contracts.
Analyze the potential risk reduction achieved by each strategy.


Step 5: Simulation and Optimization:

Simulate the performance of different cross-hedging strategies using historical data.
Utilize optimization techniques to determine the optimal number of Gold Futures Contracts for each strategy.


Step 6: Sensitivity Analysis:

Perform sensitivity analysis by adjusting key parameters such as correlation strength, contract size, and transaction costs.
Observe how changes in these parameters impact the optimal number of contracts.
